 *   These are what appears in `.operator/data/{kind}s/{id}.md` frontmatter
 *   and in the `work_items.status` SQLite cache. Engine business logic
 *   (selectors, context building, rejection handler) reads these values.
 *
 * - **Computed statuses** — `"in-review"`, `"ready-to-merge"`. These are
 *   produced ONLY by `reconcileEffectiveStatus` and written into the
 *   UI-facing `kv:work-items/{id}.status` column (the computed slot — see
 *   `work-item.schema.ts` for the field mapping). File frontmatter and
 *   StateManager rows never hold these values.
 *
